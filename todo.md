UI Issues:
- clicking on storefront should take inside
- Sync modal - on clicking sync the button keeps showing starting...
- make moodboard look good with small tiles of assets attached

- use nextjs image component
- allow switching between images in the folder in the view asset modal

- generating 10 images results in timeout on the frontend
